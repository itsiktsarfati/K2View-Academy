## Second Tab: Interfaces Configuration

The Interfaces Configuration tab contains options for telling the system the location of databases you want to scan. This tab has two main functions. You can tell system where the databases are that you want to scan, and you can run a scan of the databases using criteria set in the **Interfaces Configuration** tab.

You may further restrict the discovery scope by entering a **Schema Name Inclusion Pattern**, if you want the discovery process to scan only tables under specific schemas. Alternatively, enter a **Schema Name Exclusion Pattern** if you want the discovery process to ignore specific schemas.  
In the same way, enter a **Table Name Inclusion Pattern** if you want the discovery process to scan only tables with a specific name pattern, or **Table Name Exclusion Pattern** if you want the discovery process to ignore tables with a specific name pattern.

Review your entries as needed, and then click ![image](../images/ICON_Save.png).

The New Discovery Interface displays in the Interfaces Configuration table.
