# Login and Use of the "Source Environments"

In this page you will find the instructions on how to access the two applications which we use in order to demonstrate how DPM integrates with source systems for the fulfillment of Privacy related Data Subject Requests (DSR).

The two systems that we picked up to simulate source systems are:
<table>
<tbody>
<td width="120"> 
    <p><center><strong>Source Application</strong></center></p>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
    <p><center><strong>Access URL</strong></center></p>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
    <p><center><strong>Access Instructions</strong></center></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120"><img src="../images/00_odoo.png" alt=""/></td>
<td width="300">
    <a href="http://localhost:8069">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">
		<p>http://localhost:8069</p>
     </div></a>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
<a href="00_Odoo_instructions">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">
        <p>Access and Use Instructions</p>
    </div> </a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120"><img src="../images/00_opensourcebilling_icon.png" width="120%" height="120%" alt=""/></td>

        </div></a>

<td width="300">

    </div></a>

## Your User

As part of the sandbox environment setup we have generated for you user credentials to the Odoo and OpenSourceBilling systems used in this tutorial. Your user name and password are to be sent to you automatically as result of your registration to the tutorial. 

## Your Customer

To allow you submit Data Privacy requests we also created for you a faked customer in each of those source systems. The customer can be searched in those systems based on the name or email you have provided us in your registration. More details on how to search for it are described in the sections below referring to each system
