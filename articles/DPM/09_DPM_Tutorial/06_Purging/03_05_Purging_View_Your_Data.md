## View Purged Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar reaches its end and turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. A status marked **Complete** means that the customer data was purged from the Source Systems that are integrated with the DPM, in accordance with the company's data retention policies. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. 

Search these systems for the data that our Customer, Aleena Conley, requested to be deleted. You should not be able to locate the data as it is no longer in either system.

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".
