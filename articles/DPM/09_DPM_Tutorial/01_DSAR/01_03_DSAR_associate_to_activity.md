# Associate the DSAR Flow with a Regulation and Activity

In the previous steps, we configured a Flow that performs the Tasks to retrieve customer data.

For this Flow to be visible to a customer who wants to submit a Request, it should be associated with an Activity, under a specific Regulation. You can read more details about [Regulations](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module/08_Regulations.md) and [Activities](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module/09_Activities.md) in the DPM User Guide. 

We will now create a new Regulation, add a new Activity under it, and then we will associate the "DSAR Tutorial" Flow. 

1. Select the menu option **Regulation List**.

2. Click ![image](../images/01_03_DSAR_New_Regulation_Icon.png) at the top-right of the Regulation List screen, to create a new Regulation. Populate the information for this new Regulation as shown below.

After you save the new Regulation, the screen of Activities for this Regulation displays, initially empty because no Activity has been created.

3. Click ![image](../images/01_03_DSAR_New_Activity_Icon.png) to add a new Activity under this Regulation. Populate the information for this new Activity as shown below, selecting **DSAR Tutorial** in the **Flow Name** field, which is the Flow that you have created in the previous steps.

This screen allows additional configurations, including the following examples.

- Use the ![image](../images/01_03_DSAR_Link_Activity_Allow_Extension_Icon.png) icon in order to allow extension of the duration of the Activity.
- Use the ![image](../images/01_03_DSAR_Link_Activity_Automatic_Extension_Icon.png) icon, which will result in automatic extension of the Activity SLA before it becomes overdue. The **Days Before Due Date** field defines how many days before the due date of a Request the automatic extension should be triggered.

Saving the new Activity makes the new Flow we created available for customers to submit Requests based on the Flow.

The submission and execution of such requests is described in the next section of this tutorial: [DSAR Fulfillment Process](/articles/DPM/09_DPM_Tutorial/02_DSAR_Fulfillment/02_00_DSAR_Fulfillment_intro.md).
