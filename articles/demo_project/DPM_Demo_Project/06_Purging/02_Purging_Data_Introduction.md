## Purging Data Introduction

When a Customer enters a New Request, the system displays the Request Details screen.  The list of Request Types and the information provided for each  is defined by implementation using the Admin module. 

When accessing this menu option, the Customer can review the Request Types connected to each Regulation, submit a Request to delete their data, and view the deleted data in the demo "Source Systems".
