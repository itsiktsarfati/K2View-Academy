# TDM Installation

## TDM Installation  -  Prerequisites

The following components must be installed as a prerequisite:

- **Fabric Docker** -  Fabric 6.5.x and above for TDM 7.1.
- **PostgreSQL DB** - the TDM DB tables are created on a PostgreSQL DB. Note that you can either use a PostgreSQL v9.6 or v13 versions. 

## TDM Package Content

The TDM package creates the following sub directories: 

- apps/nodejs:
  - This is the Node.js component. The TDM GUI works with **10.20.1** Node.js version.
- apps/pgsql-9.6:
  - This directory is needed to enable running the TDM scripts to create the TDM DB on the pre-installed PostgreSQL DB.
- webserver/static/TDM:
  - This directory contain the code of the TDM GUI application.
- TDMGUI:
  - Contains the scripts to create the TDM DB and the HTML of the TDM API DOC.

When openning the TDM package the package also updates the following:

- Updates the **.bash_profile** file:
  - Adds the $K2_HOME/apps/pgsql-9.6/bin/ and $K2_HOME/apps/nodejs/bin to the PATH variable.
  - Adds $K2_HOME/apps/pgsql-9.6/lib/ to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
- Updates fabric/staticWeb/apps.json:
  - Add the TDM to Fabric Web Framework applications.
  - Click for more information about [adding applications to Fabric Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/02_preintegrated_apps_overview.md).

### Installation guidelines for TDM Package on the Fabric Docker

- Download the the TDM package from the download page. Copy it under the  $K2_HOME directory and untar it using the following command:

  ```
  tar -zxvf <TDM GUI tar file>
  ```

  **Example:**

  **tar -zxvf tdmgui7.1.0_1.tar.gz**

- Restart the Fabric node.

- **Notes:**
  - It is possible to install the TDM application on several Fabric nodes of Fabric cluster, but all of them must work with the same TDM DB.
  - All Fabric nodes must work with the same Redis to have an alignment of the sequence and masking values, generated by the TDM tasks.
  - The TDM and Redis interfaces are defined in Fabric project.

### Redis

The Redis must run in one of the Fabric nodes. All Fabric nodes must work with the same Redis.

#### Open the Redis Port

- Edit the **docker-compose.yml** file of Fabric docker and add the Redis port to the ports list:  

  ```
  - "6379:6379"
  ```

  

- Run the following command to create and start the container: 

  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  

#### Start Redis on One of the Fabric Nodes

- Go to $K2_HOME/apps/redis/src and run:

```
nohup ./redis-server /usr/local/k2view/apps/redis/redis.conf &
```

#### Adding a Password to Redis (Optional)

- It is possible to set a password on Redis. Do the following steps to add a password to Redis:

- Run the following commands on the Fabric node:

  ```
  ./redis-cli
  CONFIG SET requirepass <password>
  AUTH <password>
  ```

- The IP address and the Redis password must also be populated in the Redis interface in Fabric project.

## Update the TDM APIDOC (Optional)

The TDM APIDOC html file is located on the TDM node under **$K2_HOME/webserver/static/TDM/apidoc** directory.

The TDM APIDOC describes all the Web-Services in the Fabric project including the TDM Web-Services imported from the TDM Library.

Following steps should be following if a new APIDOC should be generated to include project custom APIs:

1. Import from the updated TDM library the following objects:

   - TDM_APIDOC_JSON interface (local file interface)- this interface contains the location of the TDM APIDOC Json file.
   - buildTdmApiJSON Broadway flow.
 
2. Edit the **TDM_APIDOC_JSON** interface or define the TDM_APIDOC directory under C:\k2view\ local directory.

3. Deploy Fabric project's Web-Services to the local debug server.

4. Run **buildTdmApiJSON** Broadway flow to create a JSON under the local directory of **TDM_APIDOC_JSON** interface.

5. Open the Swagger editor using the following URL: https://editor.swagger.io/.

6. In the Swagger Editor:

   - Click **File > Import File** and select the **TDM_APIDOC.json** generated by the Broadway flow.
   - Click **Generate Client > html2** to download a zip file with the HTML file to your working station.

7. Extract the zip file and copy the generated HTML file under  **$K2_HOME/webserver/static/TDM/apidoc** directory of the Fabric node where the TDM is installed.

8. Open the TDM GUI and click the API Doc tab. Verify that the API doc is displayed properly.

   
## Create the TDM PostgreSQL DB (in case of new installation)

- Go to **$K2_HOME/TDMGUI/createTDMDB** directory in Fabric docker.

- Set the following environment variables:

  ```shell
  export $DB=<postgreSQL DB name>;
  export $PG_USER=<postgreSQL DB user name>; 
  export PGPASSWORD=<postgreSQL DB pwd>;
  export PG_HOST=<postgreSQL DB host>;
  export PG_PORT=<postgreSQL DB port>;
  ```

- Add execution permissions to **createk2TDMDB.sh**.

- Run **createk2TDMDB.sh** script.

## Upgrade the TDM PostgreSQL DB (if not a new installation)

- Go to **$K2_HOME/TDMGUI/createTDMDB/updateTDMDB** directory in Fabric docker.

- Set the following environment variables:

  ```shell
  export PG_HOST=<postgreSQL DB host>;
  export PG_PORT=<postgreSQL DB port>;
  ```

- Add execution permissions to **updatek2TDMDB.sh**.

- Run **createk2TDMDB.sh** script.
