## Navigating the Results Tab

After the DPM system has searched the databases of all systems within the company for PII data, you can search within the Discovery Results at a detailed level. The Results tab displays these details, letting you narrow down the list by a number of filters. You can manage the Results List view in a variety of ways using the drop-down lists along the top of the screen. 

### Filtering Results

For demonstration purposes, we will narrow down the Results list to only display returns of one parameter. 

Click the ![image](/articles/DPM/images/ICON_Clear.jpg) button to reset all criteria for returning results to the default selections.
