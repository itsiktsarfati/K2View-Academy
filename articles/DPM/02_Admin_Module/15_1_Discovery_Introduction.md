# Personal Data Discovery

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data is information that could be used to conduct identity theft or other crimes against a person. High-level examples of this data include healthcare information, social security numbers, bank account numbers, or credit card data. It could also be more simple information, such as last names, addresses, and birth dates. Any personal data can be an attractive target to criminals, as it can be used for an array of unlawful activities, from basic fraud to identity theft. 

Breaches in a companyâ€™s PII data can ultimately result in a multitude of losses, including customer trust and loyalty. Understanding where this information resides in your systems and preventing its unauthorized release are important measures that every business should conduct to keep a customer's personal data secure.

PII discovery is a process that detects patterns by applying various analytical methods. A company can have multiple source systems, each one using its own database. For each of these databases, the DPM system can analyze the data and column names at a granular level to discover which database table or column holds data that could identify a customer, or potentially reveal additional information that should remain private. 

The Discovery Matching Rules function of the DPM system lets you search databases of all systems within the company for personal data that may be protected by privacy legislation. You can create rules to either match or exclude data during a database search, configure regular expression (RegEx) schemas and table patterns, and view the discovery results using an array of filters.

## Discovery Matching Rules Overview

There are three activity phases in the Discovery Matching Rules function.

- Define a set of rules to use for the PII discovery process.
- Define interfaces (systems and databases you can connect to search for PII data).
- Execute the discovery and review the results to determine which actions to take for each field indicated by the discovery process.
