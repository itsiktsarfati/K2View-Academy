## Review Masked Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar reaches the end and turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. A status marked **Complete** means that data relating to the Customer is now masked in the source systems that are integrated with the DPM. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

Search these systems for the Customer that requested to be masked, using its first name - Rick in our example. You will find that the data for this customer in both systems was masked, except for the **First Name** field.
