Set the **Probability** percentage of the New Matching Rule. For example, when you validate a social security number, the 9-digit number could be an account number of the same format. Therefore, the Probability would be lower. For this tutorial, we will set the Probability to **80**%.

The New Matching Rule displays in the Matching Rules table. If your table contains entries that span across multiple screen pages, you can distill the results by selecting the relevant Matching Type. Since we chose the “Data” Matching Type for the New Matching Rule, select **Data** from the Matching Type dropdown list.
