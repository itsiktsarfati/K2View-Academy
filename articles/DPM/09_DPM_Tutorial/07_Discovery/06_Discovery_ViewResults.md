### View Discovery Results

When you Submit a Discovery Request, the system will check which Interfaces have been written and that are Active. It will run all the matching rules. The Results tab displays a list of results, letting you narrow down the list by a number of filters. 

Click the ![image](/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/images/07_13_Discovery_ResultsTab.jpg) tab. The Results screen displays the results of clicking <Submit Discovery Request button image> in the Interfaces tab.
