# Finalize the DSAR Flow

The Flow you have created in the previous steps can be modified as long as it is in draft status. However, in order to be able to use this Flow in an Activity that can be requested by a customer, the Flow should first be "marked as complete". 

To mark your Flow as complete, select the <img src="/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/images/01_02_04_DSAR_Mark_As_Complete_Icon.png" width="5%" height="5%"> icon at the top of the Flow window in order to mark the Flow as complete.

As a result, the Flow status is now marked as Completed and no further changes can be done to this Flow.
