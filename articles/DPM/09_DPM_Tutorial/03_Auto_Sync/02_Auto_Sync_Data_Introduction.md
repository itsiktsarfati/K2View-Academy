## Auto Sync Data Introduction

K2View's DPM System is based on a powerful data integration platform, providing you with versatile integration capabilities with any source system. It seamlessly orchestrates the synchronization (Auto Sync) process so that you can perform data collection, rectification, anonymization, or purging based on the latest data, eliminating the need for separate synchronization processes or manual activities.

Using a Customer we created named Rick Jones, you will perform the following activities.

1. Submit an automatic Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) for Mr. Jones.

2. Once the DSAR fulfillment is completed, view the data that was collected in one of the two "source systems" we set up for simulation purposes to ensure that it reflects the source data.

3. Perform a data change for Mr. Jones in one of the "source systems".

4. Submit a second DSAR for Mr. Jones. You will observe that the data change in the "source system" is automatically captured by the DPM System, and is reflected in the data collected by the DSAR activity.

To streamline the execution of the two DSARs in this section, we will use a fully automated DSAR Flow, so that the results can be obtained without any intervention.

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".
