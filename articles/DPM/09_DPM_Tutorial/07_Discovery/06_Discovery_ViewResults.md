## Third Tab: View Discovery Results

After the DPM system has searched the databases of all systems within the company for PII data, you can search within the Discovery Results at a detailed level. The Results tab displays these details, letting you narrow down the list by a number of filters. You can manage the Results List view in a variety of ways using the drop-down lists along the top of the screen. 

**Note**: If you know the Discovery ID of the Request you submitted, you can manually enter it into the **Discovery ID** field. This is the only search option that does not provide a drop-down list of choices.
