### Submit a Discovery Request

When you Submit a Discovery Request, the system will check which Interfaces have been listed and are marked as Active. On each of the active interfaces it will run all the matching rules that were defined in the first tab.

Click the ![image](../images/ICON_SubmitDiscovery.jpg) button, located in the lower-right of the Interfaces Configuration screen. The request you submitted will display under the Discovery Requests section, located along the bottom of the Interfaces Configuration tab.
