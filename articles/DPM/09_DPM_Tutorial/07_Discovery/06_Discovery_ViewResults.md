## Third Tab: View Discovery Results

When you Submit a Discovery Request, the system will check which Interfaces have been written and that are Active. It will run all the matching rules. The Results tab displays a list of results, letting you narrow down the list by a number of filters. 

Each of the fields that appear in this list was identified by the discovery process as potentially including PII data.
