## Results Tab Overview

When you submit a Discovery Request, the system will check which Interfaces have been written and that are Active. The Results tab displays the details of every Request you have submitted. These details include search returns based on parameters you entered when adding or editing interfaces in the Interfaces Configuration tab; therefore, each of the fields that appear in this list was identified by the discovery process as potentially including PII data.
