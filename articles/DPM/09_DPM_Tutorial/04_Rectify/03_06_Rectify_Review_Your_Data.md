## Review Rectified Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar reaches the end and turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. In a real-world environment, a status marked **Complete** means that data relating to the Customer is now rectified in all the Source Systems that were integrated with DPM. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. Search these systems for the data that our Customer, Rick Jones, requested to be rectified.

To access the two "source applications" that we use to simulate source systems follow the instructions provided at: Access Source Systems.
