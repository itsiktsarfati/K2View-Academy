## Submit a Request to Purge Data

When submitting a new request, the Customer first selects the relevant Regulation from the **Regulation** dropdown list. The list of Request Types presented at the bottom of the submission form changes according to the selected Regulation. Once the Request type is selected, the right side of the form displays the list of fields to be completed before submitting the request. This list is automatically built, in accordance with the Request type.

In accordance with the selected Regulation, a Customer may have the option to purge or delete their data from the system.

Select a Regulation from the drop-down list. For this tutorial, we will select **CCPA**.
