## Submit a First Request

When submitting a new Request, the Customer first selects the relevant Regulation from the **Regulation** dropdown list. The list of Request Types presented at the bottom of the submission form changes according to the selected Regulation. Once the **Request Type** is selected, the right side of the form displays a list of fields to complete before submitting the request. This list is automatically built, in accordance with the Request Type.

For this tutorial, we will submit a Request to rectify Customer data. This will ensure that data is not masked or removed from the system, making it easier to view in the source systems.

The **Data Rectification** Request Type under the **CCPA** Regulation displays both phone number and email address entry fields. The entry fields that display depend on source systems and any options you designate for the Customer as modifiable data. 

Complete the field(s) on the right side of the form.
