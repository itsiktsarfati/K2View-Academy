# DSAR Flow Creation

In this section, the actual DSAR Flow is configured. As described at the DPM user guide [Flows](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module/03_Flows.md) chapter, each Flow is composed of one or more sequential Stages, and each Stage is composed of one or more Tasks. Those Tasks are the actual brick stones composing the DSAR fulfilment process. Tasks can be configured in many different ways; a Task can be configured to run in parallel or sequential to another task, Task can be manual or automatic, it can be conditional to the results of another Task, it can utilize inputs from previous Task, can receive input from the customer at the request submission moment and much more.  

The creation of Flows using K2View DPM provides limitless flexibility - The DSAR Flow we will create in this section include several Tasks as an example of Flow configuration, but naturally when you configure the Flows as part of your own project, you can implement any number of Tasks and sequence in accordance to your needs.  

Assuming you reached this section after following the login steps in the previous section of this tutorial, you are now looking at the DPM Admin main screen, and the menu at the left of the screen is the Admin menu.
