## Data Rectification Introduction

When a Customer enters a New Request, the system displays the Request Details screen. The list of Request Types and the information provided for each is defined by implementation using the Admin module.

Data rectification lets the Customer update or correct their information in the system. Information held in the system can be modified at a narrow scope. Forexample, they may not want to simply update their "address", but rather update their "mailing address" while leaving their "shipping address" unchanged. Any information the Customer is allowed to change will vary according to source systems and any options you design for the Customer to view as modifiable data. After submitting their Request, the Customer receives an email notification of the change completion. The Customer will receive an email notification of the change completion. They can also view the source systems for any updated data and run the process of a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR).

For this tutorial, we will assume that a Customer named Rick Jones wants to update the phone number and email address data your company holds afor him. You can search for this Customer and view his data by accessing our two source systems, which are Odoo and OSB. We will now show you how to submit a request to mask Mr. Jones's data.
