## Preview Your Data in the Source Systems

Before submitting a data anonyimization request, preview the data you intend to mask by accessing the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes, and search for your customer's record to review the data the system currently holds for this customer. 

When anonymizing the customer data, we will change the personal information of your customer, with the exception of the e-mail. Note down the e-mail address of your customer, so that you can search for this customer once the anonymization request is complete. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".
