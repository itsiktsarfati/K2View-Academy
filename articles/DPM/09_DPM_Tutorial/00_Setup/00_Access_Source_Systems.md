# Login and Use of the "Source Environments"

In this page you will find the instructions on how to access the two applications which we use in order to demonstrate how DPM integrates with source systems for the fulfillment of Privacy related Data Subject Requests (DSR).

The two systems that we picked up to simulate source systems are:
<table>
<tbody>
<td width="120"> 
<p>Source Application</p>
</td>
<td width="400"> 
<p>Access URL</p>
</td>
<td width="400"> 
<p>Instructions</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100"><img src="../images/00_odoo.png" alt=""/></td>
<td width="400">
<p>http://localhost:8069</p>
</td>
<td width="400"> 
<p>instructions</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="100"><img src="../images/00_opensourcebilling_icon.png" width="120%" height="120%" alt=""/></td>
<td width="400"> 
<p>http://localhost:3000</p>
</td>
<td width="400"> 
<p>instructions</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Your User

As part of the sandbox environment setup we have generated for you user credentials to the Odoo and OpenSourceBilling systems used in this tutorial. Your user name and password are to be sent to you automatically as result of your registration to the tutorial. 

## Your Customer

To allow you submit Data Privacy requests we also created for you a faked customer in each of those source systems. The customer can be searched in those systems based on the name or email you have provided us in your registration. More details on how to search for it are described in the sections below referring to each system

## Odoo

At your internet navigator, type  http://localhost:8069/ to access the Odoo application. Use the user and password that was provided to you in the Tutorial welcome email. 

<img src="../images/00_odoo_login.png" width="30%" height="30%">

Once logged-in, select the <img src="../images/00_odoo_menu_access.png" width="4%" height="4%"> icon at the upper left corner, and select the option **Contacts** from the menu options that are presented: 

<img src="../images/00_odoo_contacts_menu_option.png" width="10%" height="10%">

As a result, the Contacts screen is presented: 

<img src="../images/00_odoo_contacts.png" width="70%" height="70%">

Use the **search** option in order to find the customer that was generated for you, and open its details. 

<img src="../images/00_odoo_contact_screen.png" width="50%" height="50%">

In this screen you can review the details as well as use the <img src="../images/00_odoo_edit.png" width="5%" height="5%"> and then <img src="../images/00_odoo_save.png" width="6%" height="%"> option in order to edit the data when requested by the tutorial. 

## Open Source Billing

The second application which we use as a source is called Open Source Billing (OSB). 

At your internet navigator, type  http://localhost:3000/ to access the OSB application. Use the user and password that was provided to you in the Tutorial welcome email. 

 <img src="../images/00_OSB_login.png" width="30%" height="30%">

The OSB landing page is presented:

 <img src="../images/00_OSB_landing_page.png" width="80%" height="80%">

Select the option **Clients** from the menu options on the left bar.

The list of clients is presented:

 <img src="../images/00_OSB_clients_screen.png" width="80%" height="80%">

 Use the **Search** option to search for the client that was generated for you, and click the  <img src="../images/00_OSB_edit_icon.png" width="4%" height="4%"> at the right side of the client's line in order to open its details:

 <img src="../images/00_OSB_edit_client.png" width="60%" height="60%">



Review the client information and when called by the tutorial, alter the client's information and click the  <img src="../images/00_OSB_save_icon.png" width="4%" height="4%"> at the top right corner to save the changes.
