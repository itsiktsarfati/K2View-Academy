## Change Your Data in the Source Systems

In the previous tutorial, we asked you to locate the customer Request information for Rick Jones.  You can access either of the two simulation source systems, but we will use Open Source Billing for this demonstration. Here you will see that the completed Request we made displays in the source system. We will now change that information to show that the update will display in the DPM system.

Access Open Source Billing at https://opensourcebilling.org/ and enter the user credentials provided by your company. Click the line in the **Clients** table that contains information for Rick Jones.

You can see that the customer email address was updated as per the completed Request submitted earlier.

Update the **Email** address.

Locate the customer in the **Clients** table and observe that the change was updated in the source system.
