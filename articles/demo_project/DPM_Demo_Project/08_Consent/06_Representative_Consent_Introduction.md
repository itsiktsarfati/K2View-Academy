## Representative Consent Introduction

DPM includes both a Web-based user interface and an API set to allow a Customer Service Representative (Representative) or an agent perform the same consent management activities as the customer. Activities include viewing the consent preferences of an end-user, as well as submitting a change to the consent preferences on behalf of the end-user.
