## PII Discovery Introduction

The Discovery Matching Rules function of the DPM system lets you search databases of all systems within the company for personal data that may be protected by privacy legislation. You can create rules to either match or exclude data during a database search, configure regular expression (RegEx) schema and table patterns to match or exclude, and view the discovery results using an array of filters.
