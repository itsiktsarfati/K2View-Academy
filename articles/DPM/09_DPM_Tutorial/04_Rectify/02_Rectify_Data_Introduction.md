## Data Rectification Introduction

Data rectification request lets the Customer update or correct their information in the source systems at a detailed level. For example, the Customer may want to update their "mailing address" while leaving their "shipping address" unchanged. The information that the Customer can update depends on source systems and any options you designate for the Customer as modifiable data. After submitting their Request, the Customer receives an email notification of the change completion. 

For this tutorial, we will assume that a Customer named Rick Jones wants to update the phone number and email address data your company holds for him. You can search for this Customer and view his data by accessing our two "source systems". 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to rectify Mr. Jones's data.
