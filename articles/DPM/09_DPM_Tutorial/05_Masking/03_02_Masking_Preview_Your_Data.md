For this tutorial, preview the data you intend to mask by accessing the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. 

The two applications that we use to simulate source systems are:

- ![image](../images/00_README_opensourcebilling_icon.png) - Open Source Billing (OSB), as its name indicates, is an open source billing system. Access its site https://opensourcebilling.org/ for more information.
