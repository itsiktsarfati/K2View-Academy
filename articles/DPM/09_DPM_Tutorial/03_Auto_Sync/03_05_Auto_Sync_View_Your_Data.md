## View Your Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. In a real-world environment, a status marked **Complete** means that data relating to the Customer is now masked in the DPM System. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. 

The two applications that we use to simulate source systems are:

- ![image](../images/01_DSAR_Odoo.PNG) - Odoo is an open source ERP and CRM application. You can view more details about this application at their site: https://www.odoo.com/

- ![image](../images/01_DSAR_opensourcebilling_icon.png) - Open Source Billing (OSB), as its name indicates, is an open source billing system. Access its site https://opensourcebilling.org/ for more information.

Search these systems for the data that our Customer, Rick Jones, entered in his Request.

**Note**: For the next tutorial, we will use Open Source Billing.
