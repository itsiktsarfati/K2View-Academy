## Admin Consent Introduction

K2View DPM Consent Management covers the end-to-end lifecycle of managing customer consents, including consent configuration, customer consent preferences, central consent repository, integration with third parties, and more.

The DPM provides the means for the administrator to define any number of consent topics and classify them under consent categories, allowing each organization to define the granularity of the consents it collects. 

As legal requirements and services change over time, the administrator can add, edit, or remove consent topics at any time.
