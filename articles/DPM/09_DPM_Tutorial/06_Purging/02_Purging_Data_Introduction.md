## Purging Data Introduction

For this tutorial, we will assume that a customer Aleena Conley wants to delete the data the company holds about her. You can search for this Customer and view her data by accessing our two "source systems".

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to delete a customer's data.
