# Data Subject Access Request Introduction

K2View's DPM System provides your company with the ability to create Flows for the management of any Data Subject Request (DSR) that may be required by any data privacy regulations, automates data collection from source systems, data rectification, anonymization, portability, purging, or any other DSR type. 

The step-by-step explanation in this section guides you through implementing a new Flow that manages the fulfilment process of a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR).  

The high-level phases of this implementation are:

- Create a new Flow and add to it the Stages and Tasks that are needed to perform the Request validation, customer data retrieval, thereby creating and validating the response.
- Define a new object of Regulation, and under this regulation, define the DSAR activity that the above Flow implements. 

The Flow we will create in this section can serve as a model for the implementation of any other DSR type. 

Further details about the creation Data Subject Request flows can be found in the DPM User Guide [Admin Module](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module/02_DPM_Configuration.md#dpm-configuration).

The DSAR Flow we build in this tutorial collects customer information from the two applications we described in the introduction, which are Odoo and Open Source Billing. Format this information and notify the customer once the Request is fulfilled. 

Let's get started: 

1. [Login to the DPM System as an Administrator](/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/01_DSAR/01_01_DSAR_login.md)  
2. [Create a DSAR Flow](/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/01_DSAR/01_02_00_DSAR_flow.md) 
3. [Associate the DSAR Flow with a Regulation and Activity](/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/01_DSAR/01_03_DSAR_associate_to_activity.md)

Your Flow is ready to go! 

The DSAR Flow that you have created will be available for customers to submit their Requests, as we will demonstrate in the next section of this tutorial.
