## Legal Data Steward Reviews Results

In this section we will guide you through the activities that a data steward performs as part of the request fulfillment process. 

Data Stewards are resources from different company departments, each with its area of responsibility and tasks. In the flow we have created for this tutorial, we have defined that a data steward from the legal department should review the DSAR response before it can be communicated to the customer. 

Login as a user that has Case Owner role. use the following credentials: 

- user: legal
- password: k2view

The DPM presents the Data Steward dashboard. Most likely the dashboard is mostly empty, as the only request submitted so far is the one DSAR request you submitted at the first tutorial section.

Choose from the left menu the option "Task List". The list of Tasks that are under the responsibility of this case owner is presented:

It currently shows only Tasks related to the request we have submitted during this tutorial. You can observe that this include the task that should be performed by the Legal Data Steward with status "In  progress (Manual)".

Note: If when you logged in as a legal data steward, the task does not appear in the list, it is most likely since the automatic steps that proceed it were not yet completed. Allow few more minutes to pass and refresh the list.

Click on the request line in the table in order to present the details for this Task:

Compare the data that was collected by the DPM with the data in the source systems for the requesting customer.
