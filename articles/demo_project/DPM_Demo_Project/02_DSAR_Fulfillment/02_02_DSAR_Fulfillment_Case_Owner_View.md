## Case Owner Views Submitted Request

In this step, you will login to the DPM system as a Case Owner, and visualize the request that was just submitted by the customer.  The Case Owner can view the full list of tasks that the request is composed of and can communicate with data stewards by adding notes to the tasks details. 

This step is not required as part of the fulfillment process. The purpose of including it here is to present this high level view of the request. 

Login as a user that has Case Owner role. use the following credentials: 

- user: caseowner
- password: k2view

The DPM presents the Case Owner dashboard. Most likely the dashboard is mostly empty, as the only request submitted so far is the one DSAR request you submitted at the first tutorial section.

On the left side of the screen, the Case Owner menu options are presented:

Choose from the left menu the option "Request List". The list of requests that are under the responsibility of this case owner is presented:

It currently shows only the request we have previously submitted. You can observe that the request status is "In Progress".

Click on the request line in the table in order to present the details for this request:

You can view the list of Tasks that compose this request - and the status of each task. Depending on how much time passed between the submission of the request and this step, the automatic Tasks may have already been completed, as depicted in the image above. 

If you click any of the lines representing the tasks, you reach to the  screen of the Task Details. In the task details the case owner can perform different activities such as take ownership on the task ("Get") complete the task manually or add comments which can be later viewed by the data steward allocated to this task.

To experience this functionality, click on the task called "Legal Review" - add a note from the case owner to the data steward - as shown in the image below:

For automatic tasks, if some error occurred during the process, the system presents the error as a message  similarly to  the notes between the case owner and the data steward, but marked in red. 

Close the Task Details screen and logout from the DPM.
