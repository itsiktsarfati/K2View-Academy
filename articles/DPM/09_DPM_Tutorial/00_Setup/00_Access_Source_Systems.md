# Login and Use of the "Source Environments"

On this page, you will find the instructions on how to access the two applications which we use in order to demonstrate how DPM integrates with source systems for the fulfillment of privacy-related Data Subject Requests (DSR).

The two systems that we picked up to simulate source systems are:
<table>
<tbody>
<td width="120"> 
    <p><center><strong>Source Application</strong></center></p>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
    <p><center><strong>Access URL</strong></center></p>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
    <p><center><strong>Access Instructions</strong></center></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120"><img src="../images/00_odoo.png" alt=""/></td>
<td width="300">
    <a href="http://localhost:8069">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">
		<p>http://localhost:8069</p>
     </div></a>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
<a href="00_Odoo_instructions.md">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">
        <p>Access and Use Instructions</p>
    </div> </a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120"><img src="../images/00_opensourcebilling_icon.png" width="120%" height="120%" alt=""/></td>
<td width="300"> 
    <a href="http://localhost:3000">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">

        </div></a>
</td>
<td width="300"> 
    <a href="00_OSB_instructions.md">
    <div style="height:100%;width:100%">
		<p>Access and Use Instructions</p>
    </div></a>
</td>

## Your User

As part of the sandbox environment setup, we generated user credentials for you to the Odoo and OpenSourceBilling systems used in this tutorial. Your user name and password will be sent to you automatically after your registration to the tutorial. 

## Your Customer

We also created an artificial customer for you in each of the source systems, allowing you to submit Data Privacy Requests. The customer can be searched in those systems based on the name or email you provided to us in your registration. Details about how to search for this customer are described in the sections below that refer to each source system.
