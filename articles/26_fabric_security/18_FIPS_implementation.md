# FIPS Overview

FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) is a set of standards that defines encryption algorithms and other digital technology processes for use within non-military federal government agencies and by any government contractors working with these agencies. 

In particular, FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2) is a security accreditation program for validating that the cryptographic modules produced by private sector companies meet well-defined security standards.
[FIPS PUB 140-2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf) provides the full list of instructions and architecture documents needed to meet the Cryptographic Modules Security requirements.


## Fabric and FIPS

K2View has integrated the [Bouncycastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/index.html) Java stack to ensure FIPS-compliance for all [Fabric cryptographic algorithms](/articles/26_fabric_security/03_fabric_LUI_encryption.md).
By default, Fabric works in FIPS mode off. Yet, even when FIPS mode is switched off, Fabric only uses FIPS-compliant modules.

### FIPS with mode set to **ON**

To switch on FIPS mode, do the following steps:
- Go to the **$K2_HOME/config/** directory,
- Open the **modules.ini** file
- Modify the fips entry to reflect the following value: ```fips:mode=on```

Fabric needs to be restarted for this change to be validated. This can be achieved by clicking on the server start/stop button on the top-left menu of the Fabric Studio. 

Once re-started, start a Fabric Console CLI window and execute the following command: 

```fabric>version fips;```

```

Note that:
- BCFIPS means that the algorithm is provided via the jar file bc-fips-1.0.1.jar
- BCJSSE means that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) from Bouncy Castle is used.

### FIPS with mode set to **STRICT**

To switch on FIPS mode, do the following steps:
- Go to the **$K2_HOME/config/** directory,
- Open the **modules.ini** file
- Modify the fips entry to reflect the following value: ```fips:mode=strict```

Fabric needs to be restarted for this change to be validated. This can be achieved by clicking on the server start/stop button on the top-left menu of the Fabric Studio. 

Once re-started, start a Fabric Console CLI window and execute the following command: 


```fabric>version fips;```
