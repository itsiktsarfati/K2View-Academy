# Discovery

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical Discovery lifecycle. A lifecycle begins with an Admin defining a set of rules used for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) discovery, plus defining the interfaces where the search will occur. The lifecycle completes itself with the Admin executing the Discovery and reviewing the results.
