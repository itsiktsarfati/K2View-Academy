## View Your Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar reaches tits end and turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. In a real-world environment, a status marked **Complete** means that data relating to the Customer is now updated in the DPM System. For this tutorial, access the two "source systems" we set up for simulation purposes. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

Search these systems for the data that our Customer, Rick Jones, entered in his Request.

**Note**: For the next tutorial, we will use the Open Source Billing "source system".
