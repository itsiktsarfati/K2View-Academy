## Data Rectification Introduction

Data rectification request lets the Customer update or correct their information in the source systems at a detailed level. For example, the Customer may want to update their "mailing address" while leaving their "shipping address" unchanged. The information that the Customer can update depends on source systems and any options you designate for the Customer as modifiable data. After submitting their Request, the Customer receives an email notification of the change completion. 

For this tutorial, you will perform the activities using [your customer](../00_Setup/00_Your_Customer.md). In our explanations, we will demonstrate the functionality using a Customer we created named Anabelle Deleon. We will assume that this Customer wants to update the phone number and city data the company holds for her. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to rectify Customer data.
