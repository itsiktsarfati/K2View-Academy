The **Automated DSAR** Request Type under the **Tutorial Automated Activities** Regulation displays an email address entry field. 

**Note**: Both the type and number of fields that display under the **Request Form Fields** section of the screen depend on source system information and any options you designate for the Customer as modifiable data.

Complete the field(s) on the right side of the form.

### Ensure Your Request was Marked Complete

Once the Request is submitted, the customer can access the **Requests List** using the menu option on the left of the screen and view the request progress.

**Note**: It may take a few minutes for the Request to be marked as Complete. You can follow the progress by viewing the status bar. When the status bar turns green, the Request is complete.
