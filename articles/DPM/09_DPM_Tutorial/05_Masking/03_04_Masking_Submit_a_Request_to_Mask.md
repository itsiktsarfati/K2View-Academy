## Submit a Request to Mask Data

When submitting a new Request, the Customer first selects the relevant Regulation from the **Regulation** dropdown list. The list of Request Types presented at the bottom of the submission form changes according to the selected Regulation. Once the **Request Type** is selected, the right side of the form displays a list of fields to complete before submitting the request. This list is automatically built, in accordance with the Request Type.

In accordance with the selected Regulation, a Customer may have the option to mask their data in the system.
