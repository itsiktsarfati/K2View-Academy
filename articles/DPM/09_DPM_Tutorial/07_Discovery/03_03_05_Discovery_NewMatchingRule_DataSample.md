### Create a New Matching Rule - Data Sample Type

The **Data Sample** matching type is used when the discovery of PII data should be based on a long list of optional values. For example, if you want to find fields which hold the information of the preferred language of a customer, you can ask the discovery process to compate the information in each field with a list of possible languages which you loaded to a reference table. 

In this matcching type, a table with all the optional values is created and is provided as input to the matching process.

Select a **Data Samples Category** from the dropdown list. For this tutorial, select **LANGUAGE_SAMPLE**.

Review your entries as needed, and then click ![image](../images/08_ICON_Save.jpg).

The New Matching Rule displays in the Matching Rules table. If your table contains entries that span across multiple screen pages, you can distill the results by selecting the relevant Matching Type. Since we chose the “Data Sample” Matching Type for the New Matching Rule, select **Data Sample** from the Matching Type dropdown list.
