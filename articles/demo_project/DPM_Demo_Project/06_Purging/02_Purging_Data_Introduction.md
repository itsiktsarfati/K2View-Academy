## Purging Data Introduction

When a Customer enters a New Request, the system displays the Request Details screen. The list of Request Types and the information provided for each is defined by implementation using the Admin module.

For this tutorial, we will assume that a Customer named Rick Jones wants to mask the data your company holds about him. You can search for this Customer and view his data by accessing our two “Source Systems”, which are Odoo and OSB. We will now show you how to submit a request to mask Mr. Jones's data.
