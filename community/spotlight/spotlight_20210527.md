A Broadway **Actor** represents an action that is executed on a Stage of the Broadway flow to get input parameters and return output parameters. 

Broadway offers a number of built-in Actors which address a wide range of predefined activities that can be added to Broadway flows. For example, reading a file and writing into a file, creating a table and populating it, parsing an object or concatenating a string, publishing the messages to a queue or invoking a Web service.

When your implementation requires business logic that is not supported by a built-in Actor and it is repeated across several flows, you can create an Actor using an **Actor Editor** by one of the following: 

* Inheritance from the existing product Actors, or
* Building an Actor based on your Java class.

The **Actor Editor** allows you to:

* Create an Actor, and define its inputs and outputs.
* Set the Actors as final or hidden, if needed.
* Set the default values of the Actors, if needed.
* Run the Actor in order to debug it.
