## Customer Submits a DSAR Request

In order to submit a customer DSAR request, you should now login to the DPM system as a customer. 

For the purpose of the tutorial, we have registered a user, named Rick Jones, that has the role of a customer, and we will request you to login with its credentials in this section and along the remaining of the tutorial wherever a customer user is requested. 

This customer has information in both the systems that we have defined as "Source Systems" for the purpose of this tutorial: Odoo and OpenSourceBilling (OSB)

Enter the following credentials to access user information with a Customer role:

- **Username** - rickjones

- **Password** - k2view

Click **Login**.

Once a user logs into the DPM system as a Customer, the screen is updated with two frames (windows) of information. The left frame displays a list of menu options for this module. The right frame displays the interactive components of the selection. The Dashboard screen displays by default after logging into the system.

Click ![image](/articles/demo_project/DPM_Demo_Project/images/06_ICON_Submit.jpg) to submit the request.
