## Review Masked Data in the Source Systems

When the status bar reaches the end and turns fully green, the status changes to **Complete**. In a real-world environment, a status marked **Complete** means that data relating to the Customer is now masked in the DPM System. For this tutorial, access the two source systems we set up for simulation purposes. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

Search these systems for the data that our Customer, Rick Jones, requested to be masked. The only data for Mr. Jones that should display is information that populates the **First Name** field.
