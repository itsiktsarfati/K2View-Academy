# Environment Products Tab

A [TDM Product](05_tdm_gui_product_window.md) represents a system or application installed in a source or target environment. Each Testing environment must have at least one product which can be added, edited or deleted from the environment by an Admin user or the [Environment Owner](08_environment_window_general_information.md#environment-owners).  

An environment's products are displayed in the Environment window's **Products tab**:

- To add a new product to an environment, click **Add Product**, populate the product's setting and then click **Add**.
- To open a selected product, click the **Name** of the product and then click **Save Changes**. 
- To delete a product, click the [![be_Example](images/delete_icon.png)](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/images/delete_icon.png) icon in the right corner of the Product window.

## Environment Product Window 

The Product Window holds the following settings:

- **Product Name**, select a product from the dropdown list.
- **Data Center Name**, the Data Center where the product is physically located in the environment. For example, ENV1 may have CRM in NY and Billing in TX. Select a data center from the dropdown list.

- **Product Version**, the version of the installed product in the environment. For example, the Production environment has CRM V1 and the Dev1 environment has CRM V1.5.  Select a version from the dropdown list.
