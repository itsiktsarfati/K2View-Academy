## Login to the System as a Customer

For this tutorial, enter the user credentials that were provided to you upon registration, to access the DPM system with a Customer role.

In our example: 

**Username** - anabelle

**Password** - k2view

<img src="../images/anabelle_login.png" width="30%" height="30%">                                  

Click **Login**.

Once a user logs into the DPM system as an Customer, the Customer landing page displays by default.
