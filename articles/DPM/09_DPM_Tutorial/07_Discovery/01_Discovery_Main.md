# PII Discovery

The Discovery Matching Rules function of the DPM system lets you search databases of all systems within the company for personal data that may require protection due to privacy legislation. You can create rules to either match or exclude data during a database search, configure regular expression (RegEx) for the selection of schema and table patterns to match or exclude, and view the discovery results using an array of filters.

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical PII Data Discovery lifecycle. This lifecycle begins with an Admin defining a set of rules used for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) discovery, plus defining the interfaces where the search will occur, and finally, executing the Discovery and reviewing the results. 

The following simulation of working within DPM Discovery will show you how to log in, define rules and interfaces, and execute the Discovery in the system.
