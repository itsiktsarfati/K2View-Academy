## Purging Data Introduction

When a Customer enters a New Request, the system displays the Request Details screen. The list of Request Types and the information provided for each is defined by implementation using the Admin module.

For this tutorial, we will assume that a Customer named Rick Jones wants to delete the data your company holds about him. You can search for this Customer and view his data by accessing our two "source systems".

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to delete Mr. Jones's data.
