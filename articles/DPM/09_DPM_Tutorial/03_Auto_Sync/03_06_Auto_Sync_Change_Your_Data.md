## Change Your Data in the Source Systems

We will now ask you to edit the customer data in one of the simulation source systems in order to demonstrate the seamless automatic synchronization provided by the DPM system. 

We will use Open Source Billing (OSB) for this demonstration. 

Access Open Source Billing (OSB) application. Click the line in the **Clients** table that refers to your customer.
