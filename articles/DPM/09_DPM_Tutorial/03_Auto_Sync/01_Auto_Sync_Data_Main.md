# Auto Sync of Source System Changes

This section will demonstrate the automatic synchronization of data between the DPM System and the source systems.

K2View's DPM System is based on a powerful data integration platform, providing you with versatile integration capabilities with any source system. It seamlessly orchestrates the synchronization (Auto Sync) process so that you can perform data collection, rectification, anonymization, or purging based on the latest data, eliminating the need for separate synchronization processes or manual activities.

You will perform the following activities using [your customer](../00_Setup/00_Your_Customer.md). In our explanations, we will demonstrate the functionality using a Customer we created named Anabelle Deleon.

The steps in this demonstrations include:

1. Submit an automatic Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) for your customer.

2. Once the DSAR fulfillment is completed, view the DSAR response to confirm that the data that was collected matches with the information about this customer in the two "source systems" set up for simulation purposes.

3. Perform a data change for Anabelle in one of the "source systems".

4. Submit a second DSAR for your customer. You will observe that the data change in the "source system" is automatically captured by the DPM System, and is reflected in the data collected by the DSAR activity.

To streamline the execution of the two DSARs in this section, we will use a fully automated DSAR Flow, so that the results can be obtained without any intervention.
