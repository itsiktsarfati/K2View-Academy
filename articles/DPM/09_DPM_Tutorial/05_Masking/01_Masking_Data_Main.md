# Masking Data

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical data masking lifecycle. A lifecycle begins with a Customer request to mask their data at all source systems. It completes itself with the Customer verifying that the data was masked in the source system.

To demonstrate how the DPM system can anonymize customer data, we will ask you to submit a request to anonymize the data of the customer we created for you at the source systems. To make it easy for you to confirm the anonymization was performed, we will mask all the identifiable data except from the customer's **First Name** field which we will leave intact. This exception lets you perform a search for the Customer at the source systems also after the anonymization request was completed.

While you can submit the request using the data of any customer, in our explanations we will assume that a Customer named Anabelle Deleon wants to mask the data the company holds about her. You can search for this Customer and view her data by accessing our two "source systems".

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".


We will now show you how to submit a request to mask Mr. Jones's data.
