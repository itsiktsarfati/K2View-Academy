## Ensure Your Request was Marked Complete

After a Customer submits a new request to **Delete My Data**, you can ensure that the Request task list has cycled through to its completion. When the Request is marked Complete, the Customer data has been successfully purged from the system.

Select a Regulation from the drop-down list. For this tutorial, we will select **CCPA**.

Complete the field(s) on the right side of the form. The **Delete My Data** Request Type under the **CCPA** Regulation displays only an email address entry field. Enter the Customer email address. Confirmation of data deletion will be sent to the email address entered into this field.
