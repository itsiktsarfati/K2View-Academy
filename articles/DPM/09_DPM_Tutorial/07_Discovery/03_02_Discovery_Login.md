### Login to the System

To configure the Discovery Rules, you should enter the DPM using the credentials of a User that has the Admin priviliges. 

For this tutorial, enter the following credentials to access user information with an Administrator role.

**Username** - demoAdmin

**Password** - k2view

This user is defined as an Administrator user.

Click **Login**. 

As a result, the initial screen of the Admin module displays. 

Once a user logs into the DPM system as an Administrator, the screen is updated with two frames (windows) of information. The left frame displays a list of menu options for this module. The right frame displays the interactive components of the selection. The Regulations List screen displays by default after logging into the system.

You can observe that the DPM already includes a set of built-in discovery rules covering the discovery of many of the common PII data fields.

The [DPM User Guide Admin Chapter](/articles/DPM/02_Admin_Module) provides detailed description of the way such rules are configured.
