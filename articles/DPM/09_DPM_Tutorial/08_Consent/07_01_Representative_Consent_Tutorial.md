## Representative Consent Tutorial

DPM includes both a Web-based user interface and an API set to allow a Customer Service Representative (Representative) or an agent perform the same consent management activities as the customer. Activities include viewing the consent preferences of an end-user, as well as submitting a change to the consent preferences on behalf of the end-user.

The following simulation of working within DPM Consent Management will show you how to log in as a representative, opt-in or opt-out of Consents on behalf of a customer, and view the history of Consent actions of this customer.
