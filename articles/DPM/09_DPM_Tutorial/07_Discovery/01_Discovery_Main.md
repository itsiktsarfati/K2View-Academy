# PII Discovery

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical PII Data Discovery lifecycle. This lifecycle begins with an Admin defining a set of rules used for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) discovery, plus defining the interfaces where the search will occur, and finally, executing the Discovery and reviewing the results.
