## Customer Views Completed Request

With the last review by the Case Owner done, the DSAR is ready to be completed and the result sent automatically to the customer. The last step in our DSAR Tutorial is demonstrating how the completed request can be viewed by the customer. 

There are two ways for the customer to be informed on the request completion: 

1. At the time of the request, the customer was prompted to provide an email address to which the DPM sends the confirmation on the request completion. 
2. The customer can login to the DPM system and view the status of the request by accessing the menu option of Requests List.
